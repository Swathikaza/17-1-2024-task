    <h1>Eklund, Back, Vanharanta & Visa</h1>
    <p>336to340</p>
    <p>illustrated in shades of green instead of black and white. In our opinion, this makes the
        maps easier to interpret.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several hundred maps were trained during the course of the experiment. The first
maps were trained using parameters selected according to the guidelines presented in
the previous section. The best maps, rated according to quantization error and ease of
readability, were then selected and used as a basis when training further maps. The final
selected network size was 7 × 5 . We felt that this map size offered the best balance
between cluster identification and movement illustration. Clusters were easier to identify
than on a 9 × 6 sized map, and movements within the clusters were easier to identify than
on a 5 × 4 sized map. A smaller map could have been used if a separate map had been
trained for each year, but our intention was to use the same map for the entire dataset.
A 7 × 5 sized map seemed large enough to incorporate the data for each year included
in the test. The 7 × 5 lattice also conforms to the recommendation that the x-axis be =
1.3 × the y-axis. The simpler neighborhood-set function or bubble, referring to an array
of nodes around the winning node, Nc
 (Kohonen et al., 1996) for hci(t) is preferred over
the Gaussian function in the training of smaller maps (Kohonen, 1997), and was therefore
    used in this experiment as well.</p>      .
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of steps used in the final phase was generated directly from the
recommendations provided in the previous section. Therefore, the initial phase includes
1,750 steps and the final phase 17,500 steps. The learning rate factor was set to 0.5 in the
first phase and 0.05 in the second, also as was recommended. The neighborhood radius
was set to 12 for the first phase and 1.2 for the second. The initial radius was very large
compared to the recommendations, but seemed to provide for the overall best maps. As
the first phase is intended for rough training, the initial radius was allowed to be the entire
map. In the fine-tuning phase, the radius was reduced considerably. Decreasing the
    radius in the first phase only resulted in poorer maps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kohonen (1997) noted that the selection of parameters appears to make little
difference in the outcome when training small maps. This also appears to be the case in
this experiment. As long as the initial selected parameters remained near the guidelines
presented above, the changes in the quantization error were very small, usually as little
as 0.001. Some examples of the parameters and outcomes are illustrated in Table 2. These
are only a fraction of the entire training set, but illustrate well the small differences in
results.</p>

    <p>Table 2 shows that the changes in quantization errors are very small, irrespective
of the parameters used. The map that was finally chosen was Map 1. It is notable that this
map was trained using parameters generated directly from the recommendations above,
with the exception of the network radius. Map 7 has a marginally better quantization error,
but the difference is negligible, so the map closer to the original recommendations, Map
1, was selected. The appearance of the maps was monitored throughout the experiment,
but very small differences in the resulting maps surfaced. Although the maps might look
slightly different, the same clusters containing approximately the same companies, were
found in the same positions relative to each other. While the “good” end of one map might
have been found on the opposite side of another map, the same clusters could still be
seen to emerge. This shows the random initialization process of the self-organizing map,
        but also proves that the results from one map to another are consistent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A single map including all five years of data was trained. By studying the final Umatrix map (Figure 4a), and the underlying feature planes (Appendix) of the map, a number
of clusters of companies, and the characteristics of these clusters, can be identified
        (Figure 4 b).</p>
    <p>The groups and their characteristics are presented as the following:</p>
<p>Group A consists of the best performing companies. Group A is divided into two
subgroups: A1
 and A2
. The companies in subgroup A1
 are the best performing of
all companies, especially according to profitability ratios. These companies have
very high profitability, solidity, and efficiency, and medium liquidity. Subgroup A2
consists of well-performing companies with high profitability (especially in Return
on Equity ratios), and average solidity and liquidity.</p>

 <h2><b>Eklund, Back, Vanharanta & Visa</b></h2>
    <p>Group B is an average group, performing decently according to all ratios. The companies
        in Group B have low profitability but high solidity.</p>
<p>Group C can be classed as a slightly above-average group. Group C has lower Equity to
Capital ratios than Group B. However, Group C has higher profitability, notably in
Return on Equity ratios. In addition, Group C contains the companies that have the
highest liquidity. Group C has average to high profitability, average solidity, and
    very high liquidity.</p>
<p>Group D is best classed as slightly below average. The group has average solidity, but
low profitability and very low liquidity. This group also contains the companies
    with the lowest efficiency ratios.</p>
<p>Group E is the poorest performing group. The group contains companies that are
    performing poorly according to almost all ratios, especially profitability ratios.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the groups are summarized in Table 3.</p>
    <center><b>RESULTS</b></center>
    <h3><b>Country Averages</b></h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first benchmarking objects were the averages for each country or region
included in the experiment. The regional averages consist of the average values of the
ratios of all companies from that region. By benchmarking the national or regional
averages first, it is possible to isolate differences due to accounting practices or other
        differences that affect all companies from a given country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results are presented in Figure 5. The arrows indicate movements from year to
year, starting from 1995. The Finnish average’s movements are shown using solid lines,</p>
    <p>Figure 5: Country averages for the years 1995-2000</p>

        </center>
    <p>U.S. average’s movements using dashed lines, and Japanese average’s movements
using dotted lines. The figure illustrates that the performance of Finnish companies, on
average, has been slightly above average. The Finnish average has remained in Group
C throughout the experiment, except for during 1995, when it was within Group A2. This
implies that while Return on Equity has been high, other profitability ratios have been
average. This is probably due to the common Finnish practice of heavy financing by debt.
Where Return on Total Assets is considered, Finnish performance is merely average.
Finnish Quick Ratios, on the other hand, are very good throughout, and excellent during
        1998-2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The excellent performance of the Scandinavian countries during 1995 is very
interesting. During 1995, Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian companies, on average,
outperformed all other companies, except for Canadian companies. However, the following years indicate drastically reduced profitability. A likely explanation for this trend is
the fall in market pulp prices during the later half of the 1990s. In 1995, market pulp prices
were very high (USD 871 / metric ton), but fell drastically during the following years to
    USD 480 / metric ton in mid 1999 (Keaton, 1999). Pulp prices are illustrated in Figure 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poorest average is displayed by Japan. The Japanese average is consistently
in one of the two poor groups, Group D or E. The drop during 1997 is likely due to the
Asian financial crisis. Interestingly, the Asian financial crisis does not seem to affect
other countries as badly as might be expected. The national averages of Sweden, Norway,
and the U.S. do drop somewhat, but not nearly as dramatically or obviously as the
    Japanese average.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another factor that might affect the Japanese average is prevailing accounting
laws. Japanese accounting laws are very restrictive, compared to, for example, U.S.
accounting laws. For example, Japanese companies value assets at historical costs, never
at valuation. They are also forced to establish non-distributable legal reserves, and most
costs must be capitalized directly. Also, with accounting statements being used to
calculate taxation, there is an incentive to minimize profits. Overall, Japanese accounting</p>
    <h4><b>Eklund, Back, Vanharanta & Visa</b></h4>
    <p>principles can be seen as very conservative, and so might lead to understated asset and
profit figures, especially when compared to U.S. or other Anglo-Saxon figures. These
factors might partly explain the poor performance of the Japanese companies in this
        experiment (Nobes & Parker, 1991).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweden, Norway, Europe, and the U.S. exhibit rather similar behavior, only really
differing during the year 1995, when Finnish, Swedish, and Norwegian performance was
excellent (Group A2
). During most years, these countries show low to average profitability and average solvency. The companies in question are usually found in Groups C or
D. Canadian companies consistently show better solvency than most companies from
the other countries, being found in Group B during most years. Scandinavian accounting
laws can also be seen as rather conservative, compared to Anglo-Saxon laws. Scandinavian companies also value assets at historical costs, but are, on the other hand, not
    forced to establish non-distributable legal reserves.</p>
<p>The widely differing results of the Finnish, Canadian, and Japanese companies
indicate that national differences, such as financing practices or accounting differences,
might have an effect on the overall positioning of companies on the map. On the other
hand, the financial ratios have been chosen based on their reliability in international
comparisons, in order to minimize differences relating to accounting practices.</p>
